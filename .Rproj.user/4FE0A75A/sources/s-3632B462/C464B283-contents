mapjoin2 <- mapjoin2 %>%

```


## Hypothesis

I predict that there will be a higher frequency of sightings in the central and southern US states. This is for several reasons: first, night sky visibility is better in rural areas, which would increase the likelihood of spotting a UFO. Second, certain areas (e.g. Texas and New Mexico) are known for famous sightings (Lubbock and Roswell, respectively), which may encourage UFO awareness in the region.

## Analysis

The first step was to load in the raw `scrubbed` dataset, as well as the `states` dataset from `maps_data`. 

```{r}
head(scrubbed)
head(states)
```

From the scrubbed data, I filtered to include only the sightings in the US. From this, I then found the frequency of sightings, as grouped by state:

```{r}
usstate %>% arrange(desc(count))
```

I then joined this table with the `state` location data in order to produce a map showing the frequency of sightings per state:

```{r}
head(mapjoin2)
```


## Results

## Conclusion and Summary

By far, California has the highest number of sightings. There does not appear to be an obvious geospatial connection between the frequency of sightings. It is worth noting that the midwest states have lower counts, while the southern and Pacific states have higher counts. Future studies of this data could incorportate methods such as measuring relative frequency of UFO sightings instead of solely using count per state. This would account for more densely-populated states reporting higher frequencies of UFO sightings based solely on there being more people residing in the state. Further analysis is necessary to draw any meaningful conclusions.
