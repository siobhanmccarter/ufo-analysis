I predict that there will be a higher frequency of sightings in the central and southern US states. This is for several reasons: first, night sky visibility is better in rural areas, which would increase the likelihood of spotting a UFO.

In summary, it appears that . Future studies of this data could incorportate methods such as measuring relative frequency of UFO sightings instead of solely using count per stat2. This would account for more densely-populated states . Further analysis is necessary to draw any meaningful conclusion.
