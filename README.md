# UFO Analysis

## Data Set

For this analysis, I am using the [scrubbed UFO sightings data set](https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings) set from Kaggle. This data set uses a collection of descriptors of global UFO sightings over time, including the location of sighting, the shape of the UFO in question, and other variables. 

## Question

Is there any discernable pattern to the frequency of UFO sightings in the US by state? 

## Hypothesis

I predict that there will be a higher frequency of sightings in the central and southern US states. This is for several reasons: first, night sky visibility is better in rural areas, which would increase the likelihood of spotting a UFO. Second, certain areas (e.g. Texas and New Mexico) are known for famous sightings (Lubbock and Roswell, respectively) which may encourage UFO awareness in the region. 

## Visualization

I intend to first create a frequency table with the number of sightings per state (regardless of when they occurred). Second, I will generate a choropleth map to showcase the counts in each state.
