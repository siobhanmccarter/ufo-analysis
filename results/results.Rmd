## Hypothesis

I predict that there will be a higher frequency of sightings in the central and southern US states. This is for several reasons: first, night sky visibility is better in rural areas, which would increase the likelihood of spotting a UFO. Second, certain areas (e.g. Texas and New Mexico) are known for famous sightings (Lubbock and Roswell, respectively), which may encourage UFO awareness in the region.

## Analysis

The first step was to load in the 

```{r}
head(scrubbed)
```



```{r}
map_data("state")
head("state")
```


```{r}
states <- read_csv("data/states.csv")
```


```{r}
states$State <- str_to_lower(states$State)
states$Abbreviation <- str_to_lower(states$Abbreviation)
colnames(states) <- c("name", "state")
```

```{r}
statejoin <- full_join(usstate, states)
statejoin
```

```{r}
mapstate <- map_data("state")
colnames(mapstate) <- c("long", "lat", "group", "order", "name", "subregion")

mapjoin <- left_join(mapstate,statejoin)
mapjoin <- mapjoin %>% 
  select(long,lat,name,state,count)
```

```{r}
ggplot(map_data("state")) + 
  geom_polygon(data = mapjoin, aes(x=long, y = lat, fill = count, group = name)) + 
  coord_fixed(1.3) +
  scale_fill_continuous(low = "blue", high = "red")
```
